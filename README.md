# Tickets-UML
UML diagrams (activity, sequence, states, data model) for Blockchain events ticket system PoC.

## Description
The idea for this proof of concepto consists in creating a Events ticket system.
A event organizer can create a specific event and assign it some properties (date, type, location, price, ...)
The organizer can decide tu put the event tickets for sale. From this moment the event attendees can buy a ticket.
The attendee can present the ticket at the event's location at the proper date.
A validator (security employee, door controller...) can process the presented ticket and validate it.
If the ticket is valid for this event and user, then the entry of the attendee is allowed, otherwise it is denied.
